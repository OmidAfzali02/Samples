- This app is like face recognition that smart phones use to confirm that it's you whom wants to access the phone.
- I have trained an Artificial Neural Network Model with a dataset of my own pictures to recognize my face.
- Then I implemented the model to an app that can recognize my face from either a picture or webcam.
- The libraries and modules used is:
					Keras
					TensorFlow
					OpenCV
					NumPy
- Since the model is designed for my face only, this program is not open source thus the code shall not be revealed.
- We can also train a model based on someone elses face.
- Reminder: a folder name 'complete_saved_model4' is needed to run the app with the size of around 800MB.
- The link to download the model is inside the program which can be downloaded automaticaly or manuly using wget library to download it.
- A video of the program performance shall be presented.
